# Environmental Data Science
Welcome to the course webpage for DATA 399 at Willamette University! This repository contains all R code files, databases, lectures, readings, and other resources for the course.

## Course Description
This course applies data science methods and ecological knowledge to develop solutions to environmental problems. Students will become broadly familiar with methods used by ecologists and environmental scientists, including univariate and multivariate statistics, dynamical modeling, machine learning, spatial statistics, and time series analysis. Case studies include climate change, species conservation, biodiversity monitoring, natural resource management, and ecological restoration. Following team science practices, students will manage projects on GitHub, analyze big environmental data in RStudio, and write white papers to propose science-based policy recommendations.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Design and conduct a research project involving the analysis of big environmental data
- Apply standard workflows in data cleaning, wrangling, analysis, and visualization
- Read and write code using `tidyverse` and several R packages specific to environmental science, including `heatwaveR`, `popbio`, `treeClim`, `dplR`, and `vegan`
- Implement best practices in scientific programming to promote reproducible research
- Manage complex research projects using a version control system (GitHub)
- Synthesize research findings in a broader environmental or scientific context
- Communicate scientific findings via written reports and oral presentations
- Advocate for science-based policy positions
