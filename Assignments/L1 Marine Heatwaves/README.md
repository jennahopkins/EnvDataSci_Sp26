# Marine Heatwaves Lab
In this lab, we'll discuss the detection and categorization of marine heatwaves (MHWs), using data from the Great Barrier Reef as a case study. This lab will also provide practice with workflows for data quality assurance and quality control, especially formatting data types, selecting columns, and filtering rows.

## Explore and process data about water temperatures from the Great Barrier Reef
1. Download the temperature data files from Canvas.
2. Download the R Markdown file "Lab 1. Marine Heatwaves (no code)" and follow the instructions.
3. Make sure to put your data and code in the same folder or use a folder structure like we discussed in lecture.

## Generate figures and interpret findings
1. After processing the data, follow the instructions in the R Markdown file to create marine heatwave figures and answer the research questions.
2. Write Discussion and References sections in your R Markdown. The Discussion should place your findings or datasets in a broader environmental or scientific context, be between 500-750 words (not including citations), and reference at least 8 primary or secondary research articles. You should incorporate the papers below. Then save your file as a PDF or HTML (click Knit in RStudio and troubleshoot as necessary). Turn it in on Canvas.
